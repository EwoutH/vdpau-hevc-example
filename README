vdpau_hw_hevc - a sample VDPAU H.265/HEVC video player

vdpau_hw_hevc demonstrates how to parse an H.265/HEVC elementary bitstream,
store client side state, and hand off frame data to VDPAU for hardware
accelerated decoding.

The program is designed to demonstrate correct programming of the VDPAU API
for the H.265/HEVC format. It is not a fully featured video player.

vdpau_hw_hevc utilizes a patched version of gstreamer's H.265/HEVC bitstream
parsing code. In particular, patches are necessary to correctly calculate
the NumShortTermPictureSliceHeaderBits and NumLongTermPictureSliceHeaderBits
fields in VdpPictureInfoHEVC. Please consult the comments in libvdpau's
vdpau.h for additional information.

DEPENDENCIES

libvdpau 1.0 or later, available from:

gstreamer 0.10 or later

BUILDING

Typing "make" in this directory should generate the vdpau_hw_hevc binary.

RUNNING

To run, do:

$ ./vdpau_hw_hevc path/to/stream.bin

Sample content is available from multiple sources, such as:

http://fate-suite.ffmpeg.org/hevc-conformance/

OPTIONS

vdpau_hw_hevc has a number of options. See the arguments to main() in main.c
for a complete list of features.

Without any additional arguments, vdpau_hw_hevc will open a bitstream,
play it once in decode order, and exit.

KNOWN ISSUES

The call to VdpDecoderCreate will fail at run time, unless vdpau_hw_hevc is
executed on a system that offers both libvdpau 1.0 or later and a VDPAU
implementation supporting H.265/HEVC playback.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS

vdpau_hw_hevc will only play H.265/HEVC elementary streams using the bitstream
format described in the H.265/HEVC specification. Any other formats must be
demuxed externally prior to attempting playback with vdpau_hw_hevc.

As it does not contain a demuxer, vdpau_hw_hevc has no facilities for audio
playback.

Seeking is not supported.

vdpau_hw_hevc will only play streams in decode, not display, order as of this
writing. A correct video player must present frames in display order.
